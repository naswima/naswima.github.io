#### Why Computer Science?
Growing up, I was conviced I had my life figured out and while my friends and classmates began working on their 5-year goal plans, I was already mapping out my 10-year plan. I had it all figured out, at least thats what I belived. I graduated High School with honors and more volunteer hours than the typical requirment and walked across the stage Spring 2021 with my board certification from the National Healthcareer Association (NHA) as a Medical Assistant. My resume was stacked with credibility for a career in healthcare and medicine. It was only when I got to college that I realize how much my visons changed. From wanting to become a pediatrician in emergency medicine, to telling my friends and family I switched majors one year into college was not something I anticipated happening. 

If there's one thing life has taught me, it's that change is inevitable, whether you want it or not. Change requires adjustment but it's okay because no change is a smooth occuring. Computer Science happened to be a feild I vaguely explored back in high school as a junior participant at Columbia University's SWE Engineering Exploration Expereince. I was part of a class writing codes to name and file hurricanes and I remember enjoying that event so much that it sealed the deal when I had doubts about my original major. While I am still adjusting to the world of computer science, I've decided to toss my 5-year and 10-year plans and take life as it comes my way. After all, there is no authentic experience if everything is pre-planned.
